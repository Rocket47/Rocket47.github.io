### A little reflection

Almost 100 days have passed since the start of 2020. I know guys, now is the perfect time to start thinking about annual goals!:)

Actually, I just suddenly realized that I don't have a mind map for growing in the profession

<mark>Main goal</mark>

* Reach the level middle sofware engineer (.net developer). 

So, perhaps this is quite abstract. Why do I choose it?
```
1) Easy to assess. If you have this position the goal is completed!

2) Time. It's not too long until 2021 :)

3) New activity. The achievement criteria are job offers. 
```
***

<mark>Important goals</mark>
* Improve knowledge of basic algorithms and data structures. 
* Start a career on freelance or remote.

```
1) I didn't get any special education in programming. I really want to understand this subject deeper.
 
2) The crisis of 2020 showed me how easy it is to be out of work. I'd like to create different sources of income. 
```
***

<mark>Secondary goals</mark>
* To continue to learn English (A2 => B2)
* Ð¡reate a more attractive profile in GitHub, additionally  LinkedIn
* An Introduction to JavaScript
