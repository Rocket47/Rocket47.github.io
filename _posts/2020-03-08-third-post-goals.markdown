### A little reflection

Almost 100 days have passed since the start of 2020. I know guys, now is the perfect time to start thinking about annual goals!:)

Actually, I just suddenly realized that I don't have a mind map for growing in the profession

<mark>Main goal</mark>

* Reach the level middle sofware engineer (.net developer). 

So, perhaps this is quite abstract. Why do I choose it?
```
1) Easy to assess. If you have this position the goal is completed!

2) Time. It's not too long until 2021 :)

3) New activity. The achievement criteria are job offers. 
```
***

<mark>Important goals</mark>
* Improve knowledge of basic algorithms and data structures. 
* Start a career on freelance or remote.

***

<mark>Secondary goals</mark>
* To continue to learn English (A2 => B2)
* Ð¡reate a more attractive profile in GitHub, additionally  LinkedIn
* An Introduction to JavaScript
