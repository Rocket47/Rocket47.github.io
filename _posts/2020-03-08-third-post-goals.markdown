### A little reflection

Almost 100 days have passed since the start of 2020. I know guys, now is the perfect time to start thinking about annual goals!:)

Actually, I just suddenly realized that I don't have a mind map for growing in the profession

<mark>Main goal</mark>

* Reach the level middle sofware engineer (.net developer). 

So, perhaps this is quite abstract. Why do I choose it?
```
1) Easy to assess. If you have this position the goal is completed!

2) Time. It's not too long until 2021 :)

3) New activity. The achievement criteria are job offers. 
```

### Indicators of achievement:
- I can implement projects on 7-10 thousand lines. Have at least one finished on github.
- 5 offers for this position were received.
- Learning and using a functional programming language.
- Grow up on my current job.

***

<mark>Important goals</mark>
* Improve knowledge of basic algorithms and data structures. 
* Start a career on freelance or remote.

```
1) I didn't get any special education in programming. I really want to understand this subject deeper.
 
2) The crisis of 2020 showed me how easy it is to be out of work. I'd like to create different sources of income. 
```

### Indicators of achievement:
- Take 3 courses at this [school](https://vk.com/topic-152484379_38315158)

##### a) Basic data structures (12 task)

##### b) Trees and graphs (12 task)

##### c) Sort and search (12 task)
	
- Earn $1000 on the upwork platform. My [page](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0147ba5b5aa4344122), welcome!:) 

By the way, I have already passed verification. I hope it will help me :)

***



<mark>Secondary goals</mark>
* To continue to learn English (A2 => B2)
* Сreate a more attractive profile in GitHub, additionally  LinkedIn
* An Introduction to JavaScript
```
1) No comments. Mandatory  for any specialist! 
2) I hope this will make me write more code and demonstrate my skills better.
3) Given the popularity of the language I would like to have experience working with the front-end part.
```

### Indicators of achievement:

- Honestly, I don't know the exact ways to determine the level of language proficiency except as an international exam like a TOEFL. In my case I will try to get feedback from HR or take a trial lesson on [italki](https://www.italki.com/) :)

- **Github** should be constantly updated. See a)

- I don't have statistics for my **LinkedIn** [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roman-tsenov/). I'll start by filling out each item in the profile. See b)

- Take a course in javascript profession on the [hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/professions) platform see c)

##### a) Not a day without a commit until the end of the year.
##### b) 50 appearances in a month search and getting suggestions to chat with hr would be a great result.
##### с) In addition to exercises I will need to complete 4 full fledged projects with a code review. I think it can be very usefull.
