### Why would I do something like that?

Hello everyone! 

My next activity is working on a pet-project. 

In this case, I have only one goal to start creating my own project. It sounds like this 

### "Start doing it!"

Seriously, I almost don't do my own project. Time to fix it! 

I believe that this will help me:

- Learn to solve problems I didn't know about before
- Learn more about technology
- Increase motivaiton to work
- Work better with kpi and time management

### Description of project
I implemented the round-robin algorithm in the desktop application.

More about the algorithm you can see on the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin)

Also I like this tutorial for better undestanding where is it used [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxjIlNYRZ5M)

##### Step 1. Made a development plan

##### Step 2. Time to create a UI

##### Step 3. Add settings form. Implement default mode.

##### Data storage is implemented in a standard way. Save in the app.config.xml file.

##### Step 4. Create timer

Every tick (1 second) functions are called

##### Step 5. Create listview fill logic

After selecting the "NEW" button, random names and tasks are generated by parameters according to the round-robin principle

- 1st worker => task 1
- 2nd worker => task 2
- 3rd worker => task 3
- ...
- 1st worker => task (n+1)

When timer is triggered, a function that redistributes the tasks of employees is activated with a 50% probability

#### The algorithm is modeled cyclically until all tasks are completed

##### Function to generate names of employees

##### I would like to create function without creating names first. I thought it would be interesting.  This is why the implementation is like this.

##### Step 6. Add button pause. When the button is pressed, the timer remains
