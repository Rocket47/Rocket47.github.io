### Why would I do something like that?

Hello everyone! 

My next activity is working on a pet-project. 

In this case I have only one goal to start creating my own project. It sounds like this 

### "Start doing it!"

Seriously, I almosty don't do my own project. Time to fix it! 

I believe that this will help me:

- Learn to solve problems I didn't know about before
- Learn more about technology
- Increase motivaiton to work
- Work better with kpi and time management
