### Why would I do something like that?

Hello everyone! 

My next activity is working on a pet-project. 

In this case, I have only one goal to start creating my own project. It sounds like this 

### "Start doing it!"

Seriously, I almost don't do my own project. Time to fix it! 

I believe that this will help me:

- Learn to solve problems I didn't know about before
- Learn more about technology
- Increase motivaiton to work
- Work better with kpi and time management

### Description of project
I implemented the round-robin algorithm in the desktop application.

More about the algorithm you can see on the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin)

Also I like this tutorial for better undestanding where is it used [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxjIlNYRZ5M)

##### Step 1. Made a development plan

##### Data storage is implemented in a standard way. Save in the app.config.xml file.

##### Step 4. Create timer

Every tick (1 second) functions are called.
