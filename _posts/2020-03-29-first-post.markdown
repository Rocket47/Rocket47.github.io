### Software developer's road

I'm glad to see you here. My experience in programming is 2 years.

So, I really like the .net platform. I'm going to go deeper into it. 

My immediate goal is to get a microsoft ceritficate and improve my basic programming knowledge.

### I've selected the main topics for myself 
 
	* .NET Core, C# language
	* Algorithms and Data Structure
	* Books, reviews, best practices	
	
### Actually, I want to share my new experience and go all the way to senior .net developer. Let's do it!
